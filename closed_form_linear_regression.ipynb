    "## The Mathematical Foundation of Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "As you probably already know, the goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that describes how the dependent variable changes as the independent variables change.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple linear regression, we only have one independent variable, so the aim is to fit a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear regression equation is given by the general equation of a straight line:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = mx + c $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ y $ is the dependent variable.\n",
    "- $ x $ is the independent variable.\n",
    "- $ m $ is the gradient.\n",
    "- $ c $ is the y-intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Machine learning however, it is not so simplified because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ y $ is a vector of the *target variables* (the variable we want to predict).\n",
    "- $ X $ is the *feature matrix* (a matrix of all input features) - We can have one or more independent features.\n",
    "- $ m $ becomes $ \\beta $ (theta) which is the vector of model coefficients/weights for every independent feature.\n",
    "- $ c $ becomes $ \\epsilon $ which is the error term (noise).\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear regression equation therefore becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = \\beta X + \\epsilon $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The error term $ \\epsilon $ represents the portion of $ y $ that cannot be explained by the linear relationship with $ X $. It accounts for noise in the data, measurement errors, and unmodeled influences. \n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the linear regression model, we introduce an intercept term $ \\beta_0 $ (bias), which shifts the regression line so it best fits the data. We rewrite the equation as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\dots + \\beta_d x_d + \\epsilon $$\n",
    "\n",

    "## Deriving The Closed Form Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole idea of a <span style=\"color: blue;\">*best fit line*</span> is to minimize the errors between the predicted y-value (on the regression line) and the actual y-value for every value of x. This is how we measure the performance of a linear regression model. We calculate the absolute differences (residuals) between the predicted and the actual y-values and find the mean. This is called the **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**. We also use the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** which as the name implies is the mean of the square of the residuals.\n",

    "While the closed-form solution (also known as the normal equation) provides an exact answer to the linear regression problem, it comes with several important drawbacks that make it less ideal in many real-world scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Poor Scalability with Large Datasets:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The closed-form approach involves computing the inverse of $ X^T X $, which has a time complexity of O(n³) (where n is the number of features). This becomes computationally expensive and inefficient as the dataset grows, making it unsuitable for high-dimensional or large-scale data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Inversion Issues with Singular Matrices:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If $ X^T X $ is singular or nearly singular—often caused by multicollinearity (highly correlated features) or having more features than samples—the matrix cannot be inverted, causing the closed-form solution to break down.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. No Built-in Regularization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike techniques such as Ridge or Lasso regression, the closed-form method does not include any form of regularization. As a result, it may overfit the training data, leading to poor performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Memory Intensive:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of calculating and storing large matrices, especially for datasets with many features, can be very memory-demanding. On typical machines, this could lead to slow performance or memory errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Numerical Instability:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing the inverse of a matrix can introduce floating-point precision errors, particularly if the matrix is ill-conditioned. This can result in unreliable or unstable predictions."
